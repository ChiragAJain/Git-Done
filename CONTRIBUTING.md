   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. **Run the application**:
   ```bash
   python application.py
   ```

### Making Changes

1. **Create a feature branch** from main:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature
   ```
2. **Make your changes** following the code quality guidelines
3. **Test thoroughly** - ensure your changes work as expected
4. **Commit with descriptive messages**:
   ```bash
   git commit -m 'Add amazing feature that improves user experience'

## AWS Architecture Protection

‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL SAFETY MEASURES** ‚ö†Ô∏è

- **Protected Files**: 
  - Any CloudFormation templates
  - AWS configuration files
  - Environment variables containing AWS credentials
  - Database connection strings
- **Deployment Safety**:
  - Test all changes locally first
  - Never commit AWS credentials or sensitive data
  - Use environment variables for configuration
  - Validate database migrations before deployment
- **Force Push Policy**: 
  - **NEVER** force push to main branch
  - **NEVER** force push to shared feature branches
  - Only force push to your own feature branches if absolutely necessary
  - Use `git push --force-with-lease` if force push is required

## Design Principles

- **Minimalist First**: Every feature should serve the core purpose. No feature bloat.
- **Dark Mode Native**: Design for dark mode first, light mode is secondary.
- **Glassmorphism Aesthetic**: Clean, modern card-based layouts with subtle transparency effects.
- **Monospaced Typography**: Use monospaced fonts for countdowns and code-related elements.

## Code Quality Standards

- Keep functions small and focused
- Use meaningful variable names
- Comment complex logic
- Follow PEP 8 for Python code
- Use semantic HTML and modern CSS practices

## Code Review Standards

- **Security First**: All PRs reviewed for security implications
- **Performance Impact**: Consider performance implications of changes
- **Backward Compatibility**: Maintain API compatibility where possible
- **Documentation**: Update relevant documentation with changes
- **Testing**: Include tests for new features and bug fixes

## Issue Reporting

- Use issue templates when available
- Provide clear reproduction steps for bugs
- Include environment details (browser, OS, etc.)
- Search existing issues before creating new ones
- Label issues appropriately (bug, enhancement, documentation, etc.)

## Community Standards

- **Be Respectful**: Follow the code of conduct
- **Be Constructive**: Provide helpful feedback in reviews
- **Be Patient**: Maintainers review PRs as time permits
- **Be Collaborative**: Work together to improve the project
